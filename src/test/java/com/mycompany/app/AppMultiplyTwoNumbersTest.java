================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers can result in integer overflow if large values are provided as input. Integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior if the result is used in computations.
Solution: Consider checking if the multiplication would lead to overflow before performing it. Java 8 provides Math.multiplyExact method to perform this check.

Vulnerability: CWE-677: Unchecked User Input
Issue: The method multiplyTwoNumbers does not validate input. Depending on the use of the method, it might be vulnerable to attacks if input is not checked for validity.
Solution: Ensure input is properly validated before using it. For instance, if these values shouldn't be negative or over a certain threshold, there should be checks in place for these conditions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with Positive Numeric Inputs
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test ensures that the multiplyTwoNumbers method is able to correctly multiply two positive integer inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as hardcoded values like 2 and 3 can be used as inputs.
  Act: Invoke the method multiplyTwoNumbers with 2 and 3 as input parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 6.
Validation:
  Validate that the multiplication operation was successful; the expected result was 6 as 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6. This test checks the primary functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test Multiplication with Zero as Input
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplicationWithZero
  Description: This test checks whether the multiplyTwoNumbers method handles zero correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as hardcoded values like 3 and 0 can be used as inputs.
  Act: Invoke the method multiplyTwoNumbers with 0 and 3 as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 0.
Validation:
  Validate that when multiplication involves zero, the output is zero as per mathematical logic. The significance of this test lies in the fact that zero in any multiplication operation should return zero, thus validating the multiplication logic.

Scenario 3: Test with Negative Numeric Inputs
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test ensures that the multiplyTwoNumbers method can correctly handle and multiply two negative integer inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as hardcoded values like -2 and -5 can be used as inputs.
  Act: Invoke the method multiplyTwoNumbers with -2 and -5 as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 10.
Validation:
  The expected result when multiplying negative numbers is a positive number as per mathematical logic. This test is significant as it validates that multiplication is performed correctly even with negative inputs suggesting that the method works for all integer inputs.

Scenario 4: Test with Both Positive and Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplicationOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is to check if the method can correctly multiply a positive number with a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or preconditions. Hardcoded values will be used as input parameters.
  Act: Call multiplyTwoNumbers giving inputs such as -4 and 5.
  Assert: Assert that the result is -20.
Validation:
  Validating that the expected result is -20 as the multiplication of a positive number and a negative number should result in a negative number. This test validates that the function performs correctly when given mixed (positive and negative) inputs.
