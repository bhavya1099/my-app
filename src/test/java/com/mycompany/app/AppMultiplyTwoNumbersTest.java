================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function multiplyTwoNumbers does not handle scenarios where the result of integer multiplication exceeds the maximum limit for int data type, leading to integer overflow.
Solution: Add checks to ensure operands, when multiplied, don't cross the integer range. Use Java 8's Math.multiplyExact() method that throws an exception on overflow.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: In the current code, there might be some resources (if any used in other functions) that are not properly closed during an exception or exit, leading to resource leaks.
Solution: Use the try-with-resources syntax for automatic resource management introduced since Java 7, which ensures that each resource opened in try() is closed when no longer needed.

Vulnerability: CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
Issue: The code provided does not check the return value of the function, which might lead to an unwanted or unexpected program behavior.
Solution: Always check for the return values of the function and add appropriate error-handling code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test multiplication of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to verify the functionality of the multiplyTwoNumbers method when both parameters are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise two positive integer parameters, for example, 2 and 5.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the aforementioned parameters.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 10.
  Validation: This test is important to verify that the method correctly multiplies two positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Test multiplication of positive and negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test validates the multiplyTwoNumbers method when one parameter is positive and the other one is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise positive and negative integer parameters. For example, 4 and -3.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the specified parameters.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals -12.
  Validation: This scenario validates that the method can handle and correctly multiply a positive number with a negative number.

Scenario 3: Test multiplication of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the multiplyTwoNumbers method when both parameters are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise two negative integer parameters. For example, -2 and -5.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the aforementioned parameters.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 10.
  Validation: This test identifies that the method correctly multiplies two negative numbers.

Scenario 4: Test multiplication of number and zero
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyNumberAndZero
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of multiplyTwoNumbers method when one number is zero and the other one is any number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise parameters as any number (for example, 5) and 0.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with these parameters.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 0.
  Validation: This scenario is important to verify that the method can correctly handle the concept that multiplying any number by zero equals zero.

Scenario 5: Test multiplication of two maximum integer values
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyTwoMaxIntegers
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the multiplyTwoNumbers method when two maximum integer values are multiplied.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise both parameters as Integer.MAX_VALUE.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with these parameters.
    Assert: Catch any arithmetic overflow exception.
  Validation: This scenario checks the ability of the method to handle potential overflow and throw appropriate exceptions.
