================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: No security vulnerabilities found
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with two positive numbers
  Details:
    TestName: testAddingTwoPositiveNumbers
    Description: This test is meant to check if the sum of two positive numbers is computed correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as the objective is to test with literal integers.
    Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with two positive integers as parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    Assert equals to verify if the sum of two positive numbers is computed correctly.
    The result of this test influences the functionality of any part of the application that relies on the addition of two numbers.

Scenario 2: Test with two negative numbers
  Details:
    TestName: testAddingTwoNegativeNumbers
    Description: The test is meant to check if the sum of two negative numbers is calculated correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as the objective is to directly test with literal integers.
    Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with two negative integers.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual returns with the expected result.
  Validation:
    Assert equals to validate if the sum of two negative numbers is computed correctly.
    This test ensures that the function can handle negative numbers correctly which is crucial for overall calculation logic.

Scenario 3: Test with a positive and a negative number
  Details:
    TestName: testAddingPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
    Description: The test is to validate if the function correctly computes the sum of a positive and a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is necessary as actual integers are used in the test.
    Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with a positive and a negative integer.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate the actual return against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    Assert equals to check if the sum of a positive and a negative number is calculated correctly.
    This test provides assurance that the function can handle mixed numbers which can occur in various calculation scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test with zero
  Details:
    TestName: testAddingZero
    Description: This test is to check if the function correctly adds zero to a number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as objective is to test with actual integers.
    Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers with zero and any other integer.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result equals the non-zero integer.
  Validation:
    Assert equals to verify if the function correctly adds zero to a number.
    This test gives confidence that the function can correctly handle zero which is often a special case in mathematical operations.
